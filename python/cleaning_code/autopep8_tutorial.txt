Install running pip install autopep8

On the terminal run autopep8 <filename> and it will output the corrected code

- autopep8 <filename>

To save in a different file run

-  autopep8 <filename> > <newfilename>

Once corrected (you can run pylint on the new file to check for extra unaccuracies)
you can put the code back in the original file running

- mv tmp.py in.py

This will require using a linux (bash) terminal
